# FirstPhpProject

Little script done to start learning PHP.

**How it works:**

- The script takes a JSON file as an input (initialCharacters.json) with the data of some characters. 
- It then validates the characters created and deletes the ones with abnormalities.
- Once done that, each valid character is linked with a random generated weapon.
- The new data is storaged in another JSON file (validatedCharacters.json), which is created or extended depending on if it does or doesn't exist.
